"""
Risk Scorer — computes an overall risk score from a list of DetectionEvents.

Scoring model:
  Each event contributes: severity.score × confidence × weight
  Weights dampen duplicate event types to avoid score inflation.

  CRITICAL = 25 pts base
  HIGH     = 15 pts base
  MEDIUM   =  8 pts base
  LOW      =  3 pts base

Final score is clamped to 0–100 and mapped to a risk tier.
