"""
Correlation Engine — runs all rules, deduplicates overlapping chains,
and returns a ranked list of AttackChains.

Deduplication strategy:
  Two chains are considered overlapping if they share the same primary
  attacker IP AND >50% of their events (by identity). The smaller chain
  is absorbed into the larger, preserving all MITRE intel and events.

Usage:
    engine = CorrelationEngine()
    chains = engine.correlate(detection_events)
